        <h3>what is javascript?</h3>

        <p class="texto">JavaScript is a programming language that developers use to make interactive web pages. From updating social media feeds 
        to displaying animations and interactive maps, JavaScript functions can improve a website's user experience.</p>

        <p class="texto">JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted language. It is defined as object-oriented, prototype-based, imperative, 
        and weakly typed. Along with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies in global web production: most websites 
        use it and it is compatible with all modern browsers without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript has an API to work with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions.</p>
